# Challenge-05

In this challenge I was suppsed to be able to create code in JavaScript to set up a workday calendar
I was able to replicate the background colors of the days but not change color, I also was able to get the date up to the second added to the top of the calendar
I am one week behind in the class so I will be redoing this challenge but this is what I have right now.
